## Description of the game field

The game field consists of three plots: **random plot**, **custom plot**, and **custom plot source**.

The random plot is displayed **blue** and occupies **three-quarters of the screen**.

The custom plot is displayed in **light green** and occupies **half of the screen**.

The custom plot source is displayed **green** (not light) and occupies **half of the screen**. Its **thickness is twice less** than that of other plots.

The distance between the random and custom plots is displayed on the background of the plots:

- if the distance is **less than the soft limit**, the background is **green**;
- if the distance is **more than the soft limit**, but **less than the hard limit**, the background is **yellow**;
- if the distance is **more than the hard limit**, the background is **red**.

Limits have the following values:

- **soft limit** — **one-third** of the maximum plot height;
- **hard limit** — **two-thirds** of the maximum plot height.
