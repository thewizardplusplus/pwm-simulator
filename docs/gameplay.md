## Description of the game field

The game field consists of three plots: **random plot**, **custom plot**, and **custom plot source**.

The random plot is displayed in **blue** and occupies **three-quarters of the screen**.

The custom plot is displayed in **light green** and occupies **half of the screen**.

The custom plot source is displayed in **green** (not light green) and occupies **half of the screen**. The line of this plot is **two times thinner** than the lines of the other plots.

The distance between the random and custom plots is displayed in the background:

- if the distance is **within the soft limit**, the background is **green**;
- if the distance is **beyond the soft limit**, but **within the hard limit**, the background is **yellow**;
- if the distance is **beyond the hard limit**, the background is **red**.

The limits have the following values:

- **soft limit** — **one-third** of the maximum plot height;
- **hard limit** — **two-thirds** of the maximum plot height.

## Functioning of the game field

### Changing of the plots

All three plots show the change of some signals as a function of time (just like an oscilloscope does). Thus, all plot points are shifted to the left at the specific speed, and new ones are added to the right.

The points added to the random plot have a random offset relative to the last point on that plot.

The custom plot and the custom plot source can be in two states: **active** and **inactive**.

The points added to the custom plot have the constant offset relative to the last point of that plot. The sign of the offset depends on the plot state:

- if the plot is **active**, the offset is **positive** (the plot **increases**);
- if the plot is **inactive**, the offset is **negative** (the plot **decreases**).

The points added to the custom plot source can have only the two values and also depend on the plot state:

- if the plot is **active**, the value is **maximum**;
- if the plot is **inactive**, the value is **minimum**.

### Meaning of the plots

The random plot displays some random analog signal.

The custom plot displays an analog signal (simplified) derived from the original signal (see below) by passing it through an [RC circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_circuit).

The custom plot source displays a digital signal generated by the user (the original signal).

## The game goal and statistics

The game goal is to replicate the shape of the random plot by the custom plot as closely as possible.

The game keeps the statistics by evaluating how many percent of the game session duration the distance between these plots was:

- **less than the soft limit** (**green** color of the statistics);
- **more than the soft limit**, but **less than the hard limit** (**yellow** color of the statistics);
- **more than the hard limit** (**red** color of the statistics).

The results are compared sequentially: first by the green color and only on equality — by the yellow one. The higher result is considered the best.

See above for the description of the limits.
