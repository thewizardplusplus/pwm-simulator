The **blue** plot displays a random analog signal. The **light green** plot displays the signal derived from the digital signal (see below) by passing it through an [RC circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_circuit).

The digital signal is generated by the user: when the mouse button is pressed, the signal level becomes **logical high**, when the mouse button is released, the signal level becomes **logical low**.

The goal of the game is to replicate the shape of the blue plot by the light green plot as close as possible.
