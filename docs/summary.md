The **blue** plot displays a random analog signal. The **light green** plot displays the signal derived from the digital signal (see below) by passing it through an [RC circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_circuit).

The digital signal is generated by the user: **when pressed** on the screen the signal is **high**, **otherwise** it is **low**.

The game goal is to replicate the shape of the blue plot by the light green plot as close as possible.
